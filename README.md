# hello-world
My first repository, I guess...
Hi to whoever might read this, here's a short presentation about myself :)
I'm a anonymous student among other anonymius students, being 19 yers old and bored of what I'm currently studying, I'd like to learn more skills that might be more relevant than my curent classes. What I like the most in life is learning new things, it can be anything but learning new cool stuff make me feel so energised!
